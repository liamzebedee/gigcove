The experiences we have in our life shape our thoughts - salesperson negative anchor
Nothing happens until somebody sells something
00's selling:
 - relationship building
 - relationship selling
 - needs
 - problem
 - pain
 - solution

8 steps sales strategy model:
 1. Attraction and Positioning Strategies
 2. Pictures/Video - accessing all features of the human senses. e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8bm2llxxjU - video should be for 60 seconds
 3. Opening Strategies - how you open an email, pitch - core focus: need to assume every customer has buyer's resistance
