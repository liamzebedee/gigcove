what do I need with bootstrap?
 - styling 
 - typography
 - etc.



Contribute page explanation:
  Post a gig will mainly be for us and particularly dedicated people who want to post.
  Link us will be for people who want to easily let us know about a venue we should index

Why not Ratchet?
 - not well maintained (2014 April last release)
 - button not working!
 - many bugs reported


IDEAS
=====

Instagram media related to event info
Crawler based on Schema.org event markup
User sign-in for posting reviews, link automatically to instagram to import photos
Event maps
Post events to Twitter automatically to get publicity


http://quojs.tapquo.com/
Ionic mobile CSS framewokr




If I was to make the design completely tight, this is what I would do:

JSX for all interactive components
LESS CSS everywhere that compiled instantly
Bootstrap for desktop, Ratchet for mobile
Complete access to 





















MARKETING
 - schema.org
 - OpenGraph
 - Add Twitter/Facebook


 - add 'share' button to gigs
   https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button
 - add bg photo to gig event
 - add photos from instagram http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/
 - feedback form
 - fix mapping so that we always prompt the user for the correct address
 - fix facebook login

Testing
Instagram.client.create_subscription(:object => 'tag', :callback_url => Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.instagram_subscription_callback_url, :aspect => "media", :object_id => "selfie")


curl -F 'client_id=dd175e9ccb5247a3af84707ca4a420f3' \
     -F 'client_secret=b1ebf646b4754449a340e81283af05b8' \
     -F 'object=tag' \
     -F 'aspect=media' \
     -F 'object_id=nofilter' \
     -F 'callback_url=http://gigcove.com/instagram/subscription_callback' \
     https://api.instagram.com/v1/subscriptions/

lat=-27.443747&lng=153.1718943

{
      "latitude": -27.443454,
      "id": "116826064",
      "longitude": 153.171466,
      "name": "St Peters Church Hall"
    },

instagram only allows searching by recent in location/geography or tag, not both
since the load would be smaller, try using #gigcove and filtering by location
use streaming api
distribute to each gig for moderation
