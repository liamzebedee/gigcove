getting photos after an event
#gigcove posted in location

create_subscription(#gigcove)
on_receive_gigcove_tagged_media:
  get location -> see if matches any venue titles
  get lat/lng -> search for venues nearby
  if venue found - 

    verify time within 1 day of gig date.day

create_subscription(object, callback_url, aspect = "media", options = {})
tag

lat=-27.443747&lng=153.1718943

{
      "latitude": -27.443454,
      "id": "116826064",
      "longitude": 153.171466,
      "name": "St Peters Church Hall"
    },

instagram only allows searching by recent in location/geography or tag, not both
since the load would be smaller, try using #gigcove and filtering by location
use streaming api
distribute to each gig for moderation
